        <p class="lead mb-4">First to make it into college in my immigrated family and considered a hard-working person to many of my colleagues. Although, I am considered hard-working many people think I am a funny and nice guy. Even though that kinda sucks, because nice guys do finish last. But, I am okay with that and live with that. A lot of my friends and family think I am smart and quick-witted and make decisions, almost like a leader in a sense, and push people to move forward.<br><br>

        Being alone, working by myself in order for me to become the person that I am today. That is what I have built up to my name; although it's not what I wanted to happen, it just has. I have always tried my best to succeed and try my hardest in life because it is not just me who I have to think about. I have to think and realize the amount of pain and suffering my parents and other family members had to go through in order for us to live. I will forever be grateful for what they have done for me and the family. It pushes me to become a person and a better student. My friends have also been a big impact on my life. They have taught me a lot of life lessons that my parents nor my brothers could have ever taught me. Even the people that I am not friends with anymore have impacted and have created who I am today. I think and speak because of the lessons that they have taught me, thankfully not them creating and manipulating me to make me who I am. Rather, it is the conversations and memories that teach me to become a better person, almost like steps for me to become a better person. I would not trade the world for the experiences and friends that I have made through my journey on this tiny planet. Even the worst in my life I do not regret having in my life because of the message and understanding of why they became like that and also it teaches me valuable lessons that my family or friends could ever teach me.<br><br>

        I enjoy reading, playing volleyball, gaming, and working out. Currently, I am training to bring my vert (my jump height) back to being 35 inches and hopefully, I can go past that. I love to read and currently, I am rereading the ‚ÄúColor Purple‚Äù due to the powerful image and message that the author portrays in just a single character and her experiences in life. (It is a great book and I highly recommend it!) I have been stuck on playing a lot of League of Legends, Valorant, Apex, and Chess. Having a variety of games is great because if you start losing in one game you can just move to the next. I like to exercise a lot because as I was younger I was very round and so being fit is something that pushes me forward, in a sense. It also is great to relieve stress.
